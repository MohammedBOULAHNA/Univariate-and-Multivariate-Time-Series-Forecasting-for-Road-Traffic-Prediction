# Univariate-and-Multivariate-Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Road-Traffic-Prediction

## Project Overview
The "Univariate and Multivariate Time Series Forecasting for Road Traffic Prediction" project aims to develop an end-to-end proof of concept (POC) for predicting road traffic patterns using advanced deep learning models. The project will explore both univariate and multivariate approaches to forecast traffic conditions, create APIs for making predictions, develop a user-friendly dashboard for visualization, and deploy the trained models as services and microservices.

## Project Objectives:   
1. **Time Series Forecasting**: Implement advanced deep learning models for univariate and multivariate time series forecasting to predict road traffic patterns accurately.  
2. **API Development**: Create APIs using Flask, FastAPI, and Docker to allow users to input traffic-related data and receive real-time traffic predictions. The APIs will handle both univariate and multivariate prediction requests.
3. **API Testing**: Utilize Locust, a load-testing tool, to simulate various user requests and assess the performance and scalability of the developed APIs.  
4. **Deployment as Services and Dashboard Creation**: Develop an interactive dashboard using Panel and Plotly to visualize historical traffic data, real-time predictions, and model performance metrics.
5. **Microservice Deployment**: Deploy the trained forecasting models as services using TensorFlow Serve, enabling users to access the predictive capabilities of the models through a standardized interface.

## Key Components:  
1.	**Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather historical road traffic data, clean and preprocess the data, and create appropriate time series datasets for training and evaluation.
2.	**Model Selection and Training**: Explore various deep learning models suitable for time series forecasting, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and attention-based models. Train both univariate and multivariate models on the prepared datasets.
3.	**API Development**: Create RESTful APIs using Flask and FastAPI to handle incoming traffic data and generate predictions. Dockerize the APIs for easy deployment and portability.
4.	**API Testing**: Utilize Locust to simulate user traffic and measure the APIs' response times, throughput, and potential bottlenecks.
5.	**Dashboard Creation**: Build an interactive dashboard using Panel and Plotly, integrating real-time prediction visualizations, historical data comparisons, and model performance metrics.
6.	**Deployment**: Deploy the trained models as services using TensorFlow Serve, allowing users to make predictions through API requests. Implement microservice deployment for efficient integration into different software architectures.

## Expected Outcomes:   
* Accurate univariate and multivariate time series traffic predictions.
* User-friendly APIs for seamless data input and prediction retrieval.
* Performance-tested APIs to ensure reliability and scalability.
